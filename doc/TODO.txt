TODO
- fix the death process
    - once dying, hp does not decrease with time. Why?

- add ability to look at entities/items in room

- add some basic skills
    - skills will be their own database table
    - we need a dodge and a deflect skill first
    - stealth and perception will be next
- add combat stances that change rates
    - some stances are unlocked by skills
    - skills have a trained bonus to rolls, and an untrained detriment to them
    - learning a skill means that you no longer get a penalty to doing it?
